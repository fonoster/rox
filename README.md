## Specs for Dialogflow backend

To allow for seamless integration between Dialogflow and Rox, we introduced the concept of Effects. Effects are actions sent from Dialogflow to Rox so you don't have to program the behavior every time. All you need to do is send the Effect's payload and Rox will react accordingly.

You can set multiple responses in Dialogflow. The Effects will run in sequence.

<table>
<tr>
<td> Effect ID </td> <td> Description </td> <td> Payload Example </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 

`say` 

</td>
<td> The Effect will randomly pick a textual response and play it back to the user </td>
<td>
  
```json
{
  "effect": "say",
  "parameters": {
    "responses": [
      "Goodbye!",
      "Talk later",
      "Bye!",
      "Have a good one!"
    ]
  }
}
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 

`hangup` 

</td>
<td> The hangup Effect will close the call </td>
<td>

```json
{
  "effect": "hangup"
}
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 

`send_data` 

</td>
<td> Use this Effect send arbitrary data to the client. Note that this only works with clients that subscribe for events</td>
<td>

```json
{
  "effect": "send_data",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "map",
    "icon": "https://freeicons.net/icons/map.png",
    "link": "https://goo.gl/maps/YTum2VeZSQwNB4ik6"
  }
}
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 

`transfer` 

</td>
<td> Forward call to a different endpoint </td>
<td>

```json
{
  "effect": "transfer",
  "parameters": {
    "destination": "17853178070",
    "record": true
  }
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

> Notes: The parameter `type` is set to map in the example, but you can send anything that makes sense to the client. If the parameter `allRequiredParamsPresent` is set to true, the fulfillmentText will take precedence over the custom effects.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are used in the entry point script to render configuration templates. You can specify the values of these variables during `docker run`, `docker-compose up`, or in Kubernetes manifests in the `env` array.

- `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE_CODE` - Sets the default language for the application. Defaults to `en-US`
- `OTL_EXPORTER_PROMETHEUS_PORT` - Sets Prometheus port. Defaults to `9090`
- `OTL_EXPORTER_PROMETHEUS_ENDPOINT` - Sets Prometheus endpoint. Defaults to `/metrics`
- `OTL_EXPORTER_JAEGER_URL` - If set, it will send traces to Jaeger
- `OTL_EXPORTER_GCP_ENABLED` - If set, it will send traces to GCP
- `OTL_EXPORTER_ZIPKIN_URL` - If set, it will send traces to Zipkin
- `EVENTS_SERVER_ENABLED` - Activates the Events Server for socket connection. Defaults to `false`

## Exposed Ports

- `3000` - Port to start a session request
- `3001` - Port to subscribe for `send_data` effects
- `9090` - Default Prometheus port

## Volumes

- None

## TODO

- [ ] Add authentication to secure the events port
- [ ] Include a `--log-level` flag (You can enable logs using the env LOGS_LEVEL)
- [ ] Include a `--app-port` so we can change the default voice application port
- [ ] Include a `--events-port` so we can change the default events port
